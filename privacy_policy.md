# BART Check Privacy Policy

This policy applies to all information collected or submitted through BART Check’s website and our apps for iPhone and any other devices and platforms.

## Information we collect

Your current location and destination BART station are sent to our servers so that we can look up the closest BART stations. We do not log or store this information in any way.

### Ads and analytics

To improve the app and ensure that you have a good experience, we collect usage information using [Microsoft Appcenter Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/analytics), which stores the actions you take in the app, as well as any crashes or errors that you run into. We do not send any Personally Identifiable Information to Appcenter Analytics other than what they collect by default.

### BART API

We use the BART API to get the current departures for a station, and directions between stations. We only pass the minimum information necessary to the BART API, which is the station codes. We do not send exact locations to the BART API.

### Google Maps Directions API

We use the Google Maps Directions API to get the estimated time to walk to each BART station. We only pass the minimum information necessary to the API, which is the lat/lng of your current location and the closest station entrance. We do not pass any personally identifiable information to the API, although Google may be collecting information about the request, such as your IP address. 

## Information usage

We use the information we collect to operate and improve our website, apps, and customer support.

We do not share personal information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to accomplish BART Check's functionality.

We may disclose any information we have in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal requirements; to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud or abuse, violations of our policies; or to protect our rights and property.

In the future, we may sell to, buy, merge with, or partner with other businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets.

## Security

We implement a variety of security measures to help keep your information secure. For instance, all communication with the app and website requires HTTPS.

## California Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance

We comply with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. We therefore will not distribute your personal information to outside parties without your consent.

## Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance

## Information for European Union Customers

## International Transfers of Information
